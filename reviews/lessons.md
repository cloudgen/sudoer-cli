# Lessons — sudoer-cli

Durable failure modes. **Always re-check on product review.**

| ID | Mode | Prevention | Status |
|----|------|------------|--------|
| L-TYPE-N-01 | Empty argv becomes install-ensure (parent Type O leak) | `requirement-shell-cli-zero-arguments` Type N; TP-CLI-07 | open watch |
| L-ONLINE-01 | Online verbs reintroduced (self-update / SCRIPT_URL UX) | bootstrap-trim + TP-CLI-04/10 | open watch |
| L-UNIN-01 | Non-interactive uninstall succeeds without force | TP-LC-05 confirm fail-closed | open watch |
| L-INST-MODE-01 | Install leaves `0711`/`0700` (chmod +x after mktemp) so non-owners cannot run shell ship unit | absolute `chmod 0755` + heal on reinstall; TP-LC-09/10; local-self-management §2.3.1 | open watch |
| L-TRIM-01 | Backup / restore / sudoers verbs reintroduced as if still product law | bootstrap-chain (absent domain); TP-CLI-04/13 | open watch |
| L-PUSH-VAULT-01 | Bare `git push` uses wrong active SSH vault when default face ≠ repository-user | Pre-git report + bound SSH transport; incident 20260810-001 | open watch |
| L-SETU-01 | `set -u` crash with unset HOME | TP-CLI-11 | open watch |
| L-STOR-01 | Shared world-writable storage | util_resolve_storage; TP-CLI-12 | open watch |
| L-TTY-01 | Interactive policy from live `[ -t` **inside** `prompt_*` / `about` / `$(…)` (false non-interactive) | Measure `[ -t` outside functions; helpers consume `TTY`; AC-4; **TP-ELEV-07** | watch |
| L-LAW-ROUTE-01 | Registry/REQ still say domain “not yet routed” after convert/submit/help/about are live | Retarget domain + CLI interface in the same change as routing; do not leave “Until routed” paragraphs | watch |
| L-LAW-PRESENT-01 | Domain REQ has verbs/schema but does not **name** the file-based JSON approval machine (roles, submit-when, verify table) | Domain §2.0 in product language; sufficient-check Step 3e | watch |
| L-LAW-INT-01 | “TTY login as LPU approves” with no authz table, hook snippet, or consume-`TTY` loop — or empty argv hijacked | Domain §2.2 hook + loop; Step 3f; empty argv stays help | watch |

**Related-product only (do not re-apply as this origin’s law):** L-DEPOSIT-01, L-SUDOERS-01..05, L-OVERWRITE-01 stay on folder-backup. Type O empty-argv / online-channel lessons stay on products that own those surfaces. This product is hop 0.

**This origin’s kept surfaces:** output SSOT, no basename gate on entry, storage isolation, Type N empty argv.
