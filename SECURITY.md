## Security Design Principles (CIAO)

This project follows **[CIAO](https://github.com/cloudgen/ciao)** / **[CIAO-Lite](https://github.com/cloudgen/ciao-lite)** defensive design. Security-relevant intent:

| Letter | Principle | Security application |
|--------|-----------|----------------------|
| **C** | **Caution** | Unknown commands fail closed; install fails loud if the target is not writable. |
| **I** | **Intentional** | Type 0 lifecycle only; no host-mutating domain; no sudoers-file emit. |
| **A** | **Anti-fragile** | Isolated scratch (`APP_NAME` + `USERNAME`); atomic install place with mode **0755**. |
| **O** | **Over-protect** | Protection Zones on `out_*` and install; no online channel UX. |

Full principles: [CIAO](https://github.com/cloudgen/ciao) · [CIAO-Lite](https://github.com/cloudgen/ciao-lite).

This section is **design posture**, not a third-party certification claim.

## Scope notes

- This product does **not** emit or install `/etc/sudoers.d` fragments.  
- This product does **not** write under `/var/backup` or restore archives.  
- Uninstall removes only the managed binary.  
- Local `~/.local/bin` install is user-rewritable; prefer global install on multi-user hosts when a shared CLI is desired.
